Crime in the European Union - Mid-Project Readme
Overview

This repository contains the mid-project for my Ironhack bootcamp, where I explore crime data in the European Union. The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Eurostat's crime database (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/crime/database).
Dataset

The dataset provided by Eurostat contains comprehensive information about crime in various EU countries. It includes data on different types of crime, unemployment rates, drug-related incidents, and more. The data is collected over a specific period, allowing us to perform meaningful analyses and gain insights into the crime landscape within the EU.
Objectives

In this mid-project, I aim to answer the following questions:

    Countries with the Most Crime: Identify the EU countries with the highest overall crime rates.

    Countries with the Most Street Crime: Determine which EU countries experience the most street-level crimes.

    Relationship between Unemployment and Crime: Investigate if there is any correlation between unemployment rates and the occurrence of crime.

    Relationship between Drugs and Theft: Analyze the relationship between drug-related incidents and theft cases.

    Percentage of Crime in EU per Typology: Calculate the proportion of different types of crime in the EU.

Methodology

I will utilize various data analysis techniques, including data cleaning, data visualization, and statistical analysis, to explore and interpret the crime dataset.
Findings

Based on the analysis performed, the following conclusions have been drawn:

    Countries with the Most Crime: Sweden emerges as the EU country with the highest number of reported crimes, followed by Denmark and Finland.

    Countries with the Most Street Crime: Sweden emerges as the EU country with the highest number of reported crimes, followed by Denmark and Finland.

    Relationship between Unemployment and Crime: Surprisingly, the analysis did not reveal any significant correlation between unemployment rates and crime occurrences in the EU.

    Relationship between Drugs and Theft: A positive relationship has been observed between drug-related incidents and theft cases, suggesting that drug-related issues may contribute to theft rates.

    Percentage of Crime in EU per Typology: The most common crimes in the EU are theft, fraud, and drugs.

Next Steps

While the initial analysis provides valuable insights, there are several avenues for further exploration:

    Temporal Analysis: Conducting a time-series analysis to identify trends and patterns in crime rates over the years.

    Regional Comparisons: Comparing crime statistics across different EU regions to understand spatial variations.

    Social Factors: Exploring other socio-economic factors that might influence crime rates, such as education levels, income disparity, and population density.

    Machine Learning Models: Building predictive models to forecast crime rates and understand the factors that contribute to high crime occurrences in certain countries.

Conclusion

This mid-project sheds light on the crime landscape in the European Union using data sourced from Eurostat's crime database. While Sweden emerges as the country with the most crimes, the analysis reveals interesting insights into the relationships between drugs, theft, and unemployment rates. However, further research and analysis are necessary to gain a deeper understanding of the driving factors behind crime trends in the EU.
